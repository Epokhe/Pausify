# Pausify

A handy tool for Spotify which
* mutes the ads
* controls Spotify(play/pause) according to background music.

It stays at system tray and tracks the sound coming from other programs and pauses Spotify when necessary. It also tracks Spotify window name and mutes Spotify when ads start to play.

Right now, only adblock feature can be used. There are few things to do, then Pausify will officially be released as full functional.
